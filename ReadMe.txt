Hello and thank you for checking out PupWatch!

My name is Justin Adams, and I'm the original creator and designer of PupWatch. I started this project by envisioning a tool that could be used to connect like minded people together, for the betterment of Dog lives everywhere. 

This was my first full project that I created, designed, and built from the ground up. I ended up having to use virtually everything taught during my time at devCodeCamp to complete this project. 

I used:
	-Javascript
	-React
	-HTML
	-CSS
	-Node.JS
	-Mongo DB
	-Google Maps API
	-Google Geocode
	-Twilio API

It was exciting getting to work with brand new API's, and getting them to work within my application. They add so much power and versatility to an app, and really lets your app have dynamic use right from the get go. 

If you liked this project, please feel free to use PupWatch and check out my other projects to see how far along I've come!
